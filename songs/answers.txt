1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, the audio aura can be characterized by averaging the energy,
valence, and danceability of these songs to reflect the listenerâ€™s dominant moods and activity levels for that year.

2. The calculated aura might not fully represent the listener if it overlooks the context or significance of individual
songs and changes in preferences over time. A more accurate approach could include weighting songs by listening frequency
 and incorporating contextual metadata or analyzing data across multiple years to capture evolving trends.
